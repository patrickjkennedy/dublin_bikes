# Dublin Bikes

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for Dublin Bikes - a software engineering group project developed by 
[Kieran Curtin](https://github.com/curtinkieran), [Moriah Fiebiger](https://github.com/mofiebiger) 
and [Patrick Kennedy](https://github.com/patrickjkennedy) as part of COMP30830 Software Engineering at University 
College Dublin. This document outlines what the project is, what this repository contains, and how to navigate through it.

## What is it?
The goal of our project was to develop a web application to display occupancy and weather information for Dublin Bikes.

## What's in this repository?
It comprises a Flask application for the web application, as well as a data analysis component of a web scraper and 
machine learning model.

## How do I navigate through this repository?
This project is structured around different production branches, with new feature branches being creating from these.
The production branches are:
- data-analysis
- web-app
- docs (default)

## How do I make contributions?
To make contributions to this repository, the following branching strategy is to be followed:

1) Clone the repository and switch to the branch you wish to make changes to using `git checkout production-branch`.
2) From this branch create a feature branch named `production-branch-feature-name` where `feature-name` is a 
name describing the changes you wish to introduce into the production branch.
3) When submitting a pull request for your changes to be reviewed, you should request to merge with the production
branch from Step 1.
